# memory_minecraft

This is a tribute to Minecraft in a memory-game version and also our very first project in JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
In this repo [Annasus-96](https://github.com/Annasus-96) and I used kubowania's [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw) as a base and then modified it to suit our tastes.

Thank you again [kubowania](https://github.com/kubowania) for getting us started!

Enjoy the game at  https://guidoalessandri.github.io/memory_minecraft/!
